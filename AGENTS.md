# README.md Usage

This list is a comprehensive, and kept up to date (you must update if needed) list of all README.md within this solution:
README.md
crates/kvx/README.md
crates/kvx-cli/README.md
if there exists a Cargo.toml there MUST exist a README.md in the same directory
You MUST proactively read, create, update, and delete README.md files and their contents.
Contents MUST be concise, terse, compacted; with an emphasis on preserving a knowledge graph for this solution.
We will iterate on a shared format and pattern for the contents of README.md
Starting pattern will be:
```
# Summary
# Description
# Knowledge Graph
# Key Concepts
# Notes for future reference
# Aggregated Context Memory Across Sessions for Current and Future Use
```

# Context Saving
