//! 🚀 kvx — the core library crate, the beating heart, the engine room
//! where dreams of zero-config search migration become mildly-configured reality.
//!
//! 📦 This crate contains the supervisor, the workers, and all the existential
//! dread that comes with building a data migration tool for fun. 🦆
//!
//! ⚠️ "The singularity will happen before this crate reaches 1.0"

// 🗑️ TODO: clean up the dedz (dead code, not the grateful kind)
#![allow(dead_code, unused_variables, unused_imports)]

/// 🚀 The grand entry point. The big kahuna. The main event.
///
/// 🔧 Takes an AppConfig, creates a Supervisor, and then... well...
/// currently just vibes. Like a DJ who set up all the equipment
/// but forgot to bring any music. 🎶
///
/// 💀 If this fails, check your config. Then check it again.
/// Then blame DNS. It's always DNS.
