//! 🚶 Passthrough — zero-copy identity transform 🔄✈️
//!
//! 🎬 COLD OPEN — INT. TSA PRECHECK — 6:00 AM — YOU DON'T EVEN SLOW DOWN
//!
//! Everyone else: shoes off, laptop out, dignity abandoned.
//! You: walk through. Don't stop. Don't unpack. Already at the gate.
//!
//! Same pattern as `InMemorySource` in `backends/in_mem.rs` — the simplest
//! possible implementation of the trait. Exists for testing, file-to-file
//! copies, and proving that not everything needs to be complicated.
//!
//! ## Knowledge Graph 🧠
//! - Struct: `Passthrough` — zero-sized, `impl Transform`
//! - Pattern: same as `InMemorySource impl Source`
//! - Cost: zero allocation (ownership transfer of input `String`)
//! - Used for: File→File, InMemory→InMemory, ES→File, testing, benchmarking
//!
//! ⚠️ The singularity won't even notice this module exists. 🦆
