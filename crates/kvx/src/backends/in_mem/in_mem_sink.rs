/// `InMemorySink` receives fully rendered payload strings and hoards them in a shared Vec
/// wrapped in a Mutex wrapped in an Arc. It's types all the way down.
///
/// 🔒 The `Arc<Mutex<Vec<String>>>` is an existential nesting doll:
/// "I need to share ownership of a thing that must be accessed one thread at a
/// time and that thing is a list of payloads." Simpler than before — no Hit structs,
/// no HitBatch wrappers, just raw payload strings the SinkWorker already rendered.
///
/// 🧠 Knowledge graph: Sinks are I/O-only now. The SinkWorker does transform + binary collect.
/// This sink just stores the final payload strings for test assertions.
///
/// Clone-able because tests need to peek inside after handing `self` off to the
/// pipeline. The `Arc` means everyone shares the same Vec. Communist data, but
/// in a good way. The borrow checker approved. Barely. It had notes.
