//! *["Finally," said the borrow checker. "A config that knows its place."]*
//!
//! 📦 **Common Backend Configs** — the shared DNA of source and sink configuration.
//!
//! 🧠 Knowledge graph:
//! - `CommonSourceConfig`: embedded in every backend source config (`ElasticsearchSourceConfig`,
//!   `FileSourceConfig`). Controls batch size in docs and bytes. Lives here because it's a
//!   backend-level concern — how big a page do we pull?
//! - `CommonSinkConfig`: embedded in every backend sink config (`ElasticsearchSinkConfig`,
//!   `FileSinkConfig`). Controls max request size in bytes. How big a payload do we push?
//! - Both are re-exported from `backends.rs` so callers can `use crate::backends::CommonSinkConfig`
//! - **Former home**: `supervisors/config.rs` — evicted in the Great Config Migration of 2026.
//!   The landlord was `app_config.rs`. The neighbors were happy to see them go.
//!
//! ⚠️ These live in `backends` (not `app_config`) to avoid a circular import:
//!   `app_config` → `backends/es` → `app_config`. The module system has opinions.
//!   Strong ones. And no patience for circular deps. Like the borrow checker's angrier sibling. 🦆
//!
//! "He who puts common config in app_config, creates circular imports in production."
