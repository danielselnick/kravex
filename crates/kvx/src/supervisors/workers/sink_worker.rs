//!
//! 🗑️ The SinkWorker module — now with page buffering and Composer powers!
//!
//! It receives raw pages from the channel, buffers them by byte size,
//! then flushes via `Composer.compose(buffer, transformer)` which transforms
//! each page and assembles the items into the sink's wire format.
//!
//! 🧠 Knowledge graph: SinkWorker is the bridge between raw source pages and
//! the sink's I/O abstraction. The Composer handles both transformation AND assembly:
//! - **Composer**: iterates buffered pages → calls transformer per page → assembles wire format
//! - **Sink**: pure I/O (HTTP POST, file write, memory push)
//!
//! ```text
//!   channel(String) → SinkWorker buffers Vec<String> → composer.compose(&buffer, &transformer) → Sink::send
//! ```
//!
//! 🐄 The Cow lives here (spiritually). The Composer calls `transformer.transform(page)` which
//! returns `Vec<Cow<str>>` — borrowed for passthrough, owned for format conversion. Zero-copy
//! when source format == sink format. The dream. The whole point. The Cow. 🐄
//!
//! 🦆 (the duck has been promoted to buffer management. it is overwhelmed but coping.)
//!
//! ⚠️ When the singularity occurs, the SinkWorker will still be buffering pages.
//! It will not notice. It does not notice things. It only buffers, composes, and sinks.
