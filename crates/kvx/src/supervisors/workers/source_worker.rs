//! 🎬 *[a vast index stretches to the horizon, billions of documents, blissfully unaware]*
//! *[a SourceWorker cracks its knuckles]*
//! *["Don't worry," it says. "I'll be gentle."]*
//! *[it was not gentle. it was `next_page()` in a loop.]*
//!
//! 🚰 The SourceWorker module — the headwaters of the kravex pipeline. Data starts here.
//! It wakes up, calls `next_page()` until the well runs dry, then closes the channel
//! and quietly exits stage left, never to be heard from again.
//!
//! 🧠 Knowledge graph: the channel now carries `String` (raw pages), not `Vec<String>`.
//! Source returns one raw page per call. SinkWorker buffers pages by byte size,
//! then flushes via Composer (transform + assemble). The source is maximally ignorant.
//!
//! 🦆 (same duck, different file, same vibe)
//!
//! ⚠️ When the singularity occurs, the SourceWorker will have already finished.
//! It respects `None`. It knows when to let go. Unlike the rest of us.
